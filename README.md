Offline Code Snippets Manager Single Page Application------------------------------------------------------

Note: 
  To be used only on desktop devices (computers, laptops, tablets). Not responsive for mobile phones yet.

Description: 
  This application is useful for creating your own collection/library of code snippets that you use in everyday work.

Features: 
  Add title, code snippet, and code type (such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C++, C#).
The search bar will let you seamlessly search for the title you want.

How to Save your Collection: 
  As this is a static application, once you have entered some code entries, press Control + S to save the page offline on your own device. All the necessary files will be stored on your device in one folder. You can use the application on your local device without going to this GitHub link afterward.

Feel free to add your comments or suggestions for improving the app.
